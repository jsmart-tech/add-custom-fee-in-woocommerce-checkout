Date Range Filtering: The plugin allows users to specify date ranges for generating the CSV report. This functionality is especially useful for analyzing service fee data over specific time periods.

Order Status Integration: The service fee is added to the order as a non-taxable fee, ensuring it's included in order calculations and clearly visible to customers.
